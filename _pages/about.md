I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) with a minor in [Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), working under the guidance of [Dr. Ravikumar Gelli](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/gelli/). My research is centered around optimizing Smart Grids, with a particular focus on enhancing their security using advanced techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating computer science and statistical methodologies, my goal is to develop robust and efficient systems that contribute to the advancement of Smart Grid technologies.

In addition to my work on Smart Grids, I am deeply interested in various other domains including statistical machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and robotics. I am also passionate about the potential of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and their applications in Smart Grid technologies. Furthermore, I have a strong interest in self-driving technology, where I explore how advancements in AI and machine learning can drive innovation in autonomous systems.

My research combines Computer Science and Statistics to tackle real-world challenges and push the boundaries of technology in both Smart Grids and Self-Driving Projects.
